abstract = {The current concerns about reproducibility have focused attention on proper use of statistics across the sciences. This gives statisticians an extraordinary opportunity to change what are widely regarded as statistical practices detrimental to the cause of good science. However, how that should be done is enormously complex, made more difficult by the balkanization of research methods and statistical traditions across scientific subdisciplines. Working within those sciences while also allying with science reform movements—operating simultaneously on the micro and macro levels—are the key to making lasting change in applied science.},

@article{Strasak2007,
abstract = {There is widespread evidence of the extensive use of statistical methods in medical research. Just the same, standards are generally low and a growing body of literature points to statistical errors in most medical journals. However, there is no comprehensive study contrasting the top medical journals of basic and clinical science for recent practice in their use of statistics. All original research articles in Volume 10, Numbers 1-6 of Nature Medicine (Nat Med) and Volume 350, Numbers 1-26 of The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) were screened for their statistical content. Types, frequencies, and complexity of applied statistical methods were systematically recorded. A 46-item checklist was used to evaluate statistical quality for a subgroup of papers. 94.5 percent (95% CI 87.6-98.2) of NEJM articles and 82.4 percent (95% CI 65.5-93.2) of Nat Med articles contained inferential statistics. NEJM papers were significantly more likely to use advanced statistical methods (p < 0.0001). Statistical errors were identified in a considerable proportion of articles, although not always serious in nature. Documentation of applied statistical methods was generally poor and insufficient, particularly in Nat Med. Compared to 1983, a vast increase in usage and complexity of statistical methods could be observed for NEJM papers. This does not necessarily hold true for Nat Med papers, as the results of the study indicate that basic science sticks with basic analysis. As statistical errors seem to remain common in medical literature, closer attention to statistical methodology should be seriously considered to raise standards. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Statistical Association.},

@article{Slobogin2019,
abstract = {Statistics are increasingly playing a crucial role in criminal cases. As the articles in this Special Issue illustrate, they can form the principal basis for expert testimony (e.g., with respect to risk assessments), heavily influence decisions about policy (e.g., constitutional doctrine governing police stop-and-frisk practices), and help courts evaluate the admissibility of expert testimony (e.g., via proficiency testing). Unfortunately, courts have not always been up to the task of analyzing the value of statistical analysis. In the course of introducing the articles in this issue, this article provides some examples of how statistical information can be misconstrued and suggests several reasons why judges may be reluctant to engage with such information.},

@article{Cumming2014,
abstract = {We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

In this article, we sought to evaluate statistical requirements for PhD training and to identify opportunities for improving biostatistics education in the basic sciences. We provide recommendations for improving statistics training for basic biomedical scientists, including: 1. Encouraging departments to require statistics training, 2. Tailoring coursework to the students' fields of research, and 3. Developing tools and strategies to promote education and dissemination of statistical knowledge. We also provide a list of statistical considerations that should be addressed in statistics education for basic scientists.},
